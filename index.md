### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

    Lab 5 consisted of three parts, however the part that I liked the most would be the first part.  It is notable that lab five part one tied into lab three by using the fill in the blanks idea.  However for lab five, we utilized the idea of reading from the users command line arguments.  I will admit, at first I was very confused on what “command line arguments'' were.”  Having very minimal to no experience with computer science, let alone using a terminal to test the code, I was very confused on how we use the terminal with Visual Studio Code.  Another reason why I like this part of the lab is because, in the end, it is something that functions so simple but behind the “big picture,” there is a lot of work that goes into it.

* Lab 8 

    To start off, this lab consisted of three parts.  The parts that stood out to me the most would be part one and three.  Part one consisted of using the idea of reading from a file in which code was created to find a palindrome.  When doing this lab, it would remind me of when I was younger and I figured out what a palindrome was.  I was fascinated by the idea that some words when put backwards would still be the initial word.  Now the reason why part three also stood out to me was because I was introduced to how to use the idea of ASCII to create an animation.  ASCII was also introduced to me in highschool but all we ever did was get quizzed on it.  We never actually created something within.

* Lab 12

    Lab 12 consisted of two parts.  To start off, it was always a mystery to me on how big corporations use code to create animations for animated movies, or how they add special effects to a scene.  To add on, this lab specifically caught my eye because I take pictures as a hobby and something I use is color grading so through this lab, I connected the image we created to my hobby which I feel like it intrigued me more.  Through this lab I was exposed to using RGB which is something I was first exposed to in highschool but we never created anything with it.
